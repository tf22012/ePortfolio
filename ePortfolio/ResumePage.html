                    I'm seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in the development of programming, database systems, computer operating / networking systems, and the practical application of these in my future career. Aside from my direct educational experience, I have developed strong interpersonal skills in assisting non-technical clients in debugging and setting up various wireless environments while working as an administrative support specialist.
