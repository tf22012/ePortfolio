                    I have been learning HTML for about four months, and I have developed a solid foundation in the fundamental syntax and structure of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). I am familiar with a wide range of HTML tags and understand how to use them to define the structure and content of web pages. I am comfortable working with basic HTML features such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists, and I am able to create simple web pages that display these elements. While I still consider myself to be a beginner in HTML, I am eager to continue learning and improving my skills in this important web development language.

                        CSS is a styling language used to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. Through my experience learning CSS, I have gained a solid understanding of how to use CSS to design and layout web pages. I am familiar with CSS syntax and am able to apply it to style elements such as text, images, and backgrounds. I also have experience with responsive design techniques to ensure web pages display correctly on various devices. While I still have more to learn, I am enthusiastic about continuing to improve my skills in CSS and create engaging web designs.

                    JavaScript is a versatile language that allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications. During my first academic term at NSCC, I have gained a solid understanding of JavaScript and have created a variety of programs and web pages using this powerful language. While I have made significant progress in my understanding of JavaScript, I am excited to continue building my skills and exploring new possibilities in JavaScript's ability to manipulate Document Object Model (DOM) and create dynamic effects, such as animations and interactive forms.
